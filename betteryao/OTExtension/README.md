###DESCRIPTION
Implementation of the passive secure OT extension protocol of [1] and the active secure OT extension protocols of [2] and [3]. Implements the general OT (G_OT), correlated OT (C_OT), global correlated OT (GC_OT), sender random OT (SR_OT), and receiver random OT (RR_OT) (Definitions of the functionalities will follow). Implements the base-OTs by Naor-Pinkas [4], Peikert-Vaikuntanathan-Waters [5], and Chou-Orlandi [6]. The code is based on the OT extension implementation of [7] and uses the MIRACL libary [8] for elliptic curve arithmetic. 

###COMPILE
####Linux: 
Required compiler: g++

Required libraries: OpenSSL (e.g., on Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`)

1. Compile Miracl in util/Miracl either using "bash linux" or "bash linux64" (see `util/Miracl/first.txt` for more information)
2. Compile OT extension by executing make

####Windows:
ATTENTION: CURRENTLY NOT TESTED. 

Required compiler: mingw32

Required libraries: OpenSSL (the OpenSSL library is part of msys in mingw, can be installed using `mingw-get`, and the Windows `$PATH` variable has to be set to `[PATH_TO_MINGW]\msys\1.0\bin\`.) 

1. Compile Miracl in util/Miracl using `windows32.bat`
2. Set the Paths to your MSYS directory in `Makefile.bat`
3. Compile OT extension by invoking `Makefile.bat`


###USE
To start OT extension, open two terminals on the same PC and call `ot.exe 0` in one terminal to start OT extension as sender and call `ot.exe 1` in the second terminal to start OT extension as receiver. 


###NOTES
An example implementation of OT extension can be found in `mains/otmain.cpp`.

OT related source code is found in `ot/`. 

Different compilation flags can be set in `util/constants.h`.

###TBD
The current version is in a prototypical state. Next steps: 

1. Better documentation. Clean interfaces and source code
2. Integration into the ABY framework [9] and Miracl [8] as external GIT project
3. Test and enable support under Windows
